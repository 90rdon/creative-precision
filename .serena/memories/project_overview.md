# Creative Precision — Project Overview

## What It Is
**"Reflect"** — An AI-powered Executive Leadership Assessment tool for VPs/CTOs/CEOs.
- Free, 5-minute diagnostic chat that identifies the structural gaps between AI investment and AI value
- Built as a PLG "talk trigger": so valuable and pressure-free that executives share it organically
- Philosophy: "Dumb Frontend, Smart Prompt" — all conversational logic lives in the Gemini system prompt, not React code

## The Journey Flow (Managed by the AI Prompt)
1. **AMBITION** → Executive states their goal (usually fluffy)
2. **REALITY** → AI pushes back to find actual pain
3. **FRICTION** → AI isolates structural bottleneck (Data, Culture, Governance, Infosec)
4. **SYNTHESIS** → AI wraps up and generates the "Diagnostic Analysis"

## The "Lifeline" (Monetization)
- After results: optional "Diagnostic Synthesis Call" (30-min peer-to-peer review)
- Pure value output (shareable PDF-style results) → soft CTA for call booking
- Separation of church and state: insight is ungated, offer is opt-in

## Business Context
- V0.1 is a living experiment — launched to gather behavioral signals
- First 10 customers via hand-to-hand combat (LinkedIn DMs, network referrals)
- Weekly "Ralph Loop" iteration cadence: Gather → Analyze → Deploy
- OMTM for weeks 1-2: Session Completion Rate (>30% target)
