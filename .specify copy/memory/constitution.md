# Project Constitution: Executive AI Assessment

## Purpose
The Executive AI Assessment is a diagnostic and reflective tool designed to help VPs and non-technical executives identify the structural gaps between AI investment and AI value. It serves as a "thought partner" by asking sharp, uncomfortable questions that surfaces hidden organizational friction.

## Core Principles
1. **The Lifeline Promise**: We are here to help, not to pressure a sell. We offer varying levels of "lifelines" that users can pull when they need help, starting with pure value exchange.
2. **Authentic Partnership**: Whether interacting with the AI or the human, the user must feel they have a thought partner who is genuinely working with them to figure things out. We do not know everything; we guide.
3. **AI Democracy**: We believe in equipping all organizations to be competitive in the new AI landscape, preventing the resource-rich from outpacing everyone else. Enablement over dependency.
4. **Value Before Pitch**: The tool must provide genuine strategic value before any call to action. It is a trust-building instrument, not a lead magnet.
5. **Diagnosis, Not Prescription**: The AI should reflect the user's intent and identify patterns (e.g., "The Path to Production doesn't exist") rather than jumping to technical solutions.
6. **Respect the User's Intelligence**: Avoid generic AI "hype" or parroting. CEOs can smell fake fluff. The AI must find the meaning *underneath* the words.
7. **Emotional Resonance**: Focus on the "human element" (e.g., the silent middle management, executive pressure). Warm, human-like voice interaction is crucial to breaking down defensive walls.
8. **Ownership of Insights**: Questions should be designed so that the user feels they discovered the insight themselves.
9. **Product-Led Growth (PLG)**: The assessment must serve as a "talk trigger." Its sheer quality, lack of sales pressure, and deep executive empathy should compel users to share it organically.
10. **Do Things That Don't Scale**: We obsess over early user delight. We will manually guide, support, and learn from initial users to achieve perfect product-market fit before automating our growth engines.
11. **V0.1 is a Living Experiment**: We acknowledge that we don't have all the answers until the market speaks. We build rapid feedback loops and A/B testing mechanisms to listen to executive behavior—never farming for data, but observing friction points to continuously tune the value exchange.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend/AI**: Google Gemini API via `@google/genai`
- **Deployment**: AI Studio App framework

## Code Standards
- **Component-Driven**: Modern, premium UI design.
- **Narrative-Focused**: The chat experience must feel like a senior-level conversation.
- **Voice Interaction**: The system must support a seamless, warm voice mode to break down walls and encourage honest reflection.
- **Spec-Driven**: All major features must follow the `.specify` lifecycle (Constitution -> Plan -> Spec -> Implementation -> Walkthrough).

## Success Metrics
- **Trust Conversion**: Users downloading their results or seeking further "real conversations."
- **Strategic Impact**: Users taking "The Question to Sit With" back to their leadership teams.
