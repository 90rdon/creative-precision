**CONFIDENTIAL**

*\"The discipline of constraint is not restriction --- it's
precision.\"*

**Executive Summary**

This plan outlines a 90-day roadmap to launch a digital product business
targeting AI/Data leaders at mid-market companies. The business sells
governance frameworks, toolkits, and templates that help organizations
move AI initiatives from pilot purgatory to production value.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **The Constraints (Our Reality)**                                     |
|                                                                       |
| • Budget: Under \$500 total (bootstrap only)                          |
|                                                                       |
| • LinkedIn: Under 1,000 connections                                   |
|                                                                       |
| • Network: Warm contacts exist but relationships have gone cold       |
|                                                                       |
| • IP: Partial --- existing frameworks need reworking into sellable    |
| content                                                               |
|                                                                       |
| • Speaking: Not a current strength --- build toward it over time      |
|                                                                       |
| • Approach: Test small, validate ROI, then double down on what works  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **The Target**                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| • 100 paid digital product customers in 90 days                       |
|                                                                       |
| • Primary buyer: AI Directors, VPs of Data/ML, CTOs at mid-market     |
| companies                                                             |
|                                                                       |
| • Revenue model: Free lead magnet → low-ticket (\$47--\$297) →        |
| consulting upsell                                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Honest Assessment: The 100-Customer Reality Check**                 |
|                                                                       |
| 100 paid customers in 90 days on a bootstrap budget with \<1K         |
| LinkedIn is aggressive. Industry benchmarks suggest a 1--3%           |
| conversion rate from free to paid. You need 3,300--10,000 people to   |
| see your offer. This plan hits that exposure through multi-channel    |
| "test and double-down." Achievable but requires disciplined daily     |
| execution. No days off in Month 1.                                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

**Part I: Persona, Hook & Story**

Before building a single product, you need a market identity that cuts
through noise. Your positioning must be instantly different, memorably
specific, and painfully relevant to your buyer's current situation.

**1.1 The Buyer Persona**

  --------------------- -------------------------------------------------
  **Attribute**         **Detail**

  **Title**             Director of AI/ML, VP of Data & Analytics, CTO,
                        Head of AI Strategy

  **Company**           Mid-market (\$50M--\$1B revenue), 200--5,000
                        employees

  **Pain State**        3--7 AI pilots, none in production. Board asking
                        for ROI. Shadow AI spreading. No governance
                        framework.

  **Budget Reality**    Has AI budget but can't justify more without
                        production wins. Will pay \$47--\$297 for toolkit
                        that saves 40+ hours.

  **Buying Trigger**    Board meeting in 60 days. New regulation.
                        Competitor shipped AI. CTO asked \"where's our
                        strategy?\"

  **Where They Are**    LinkedIn, MLOps Slack, AI newsletters, local tech
                        meetups, podcasts
  --------------------- -------------------------------------------------

**1.2 The Hook**

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Primary Hook (The Cocktail Party Test)**                            |
|                                                                       |
| \"I help AI leaders escape pilot purgatory. Most companies have 5 AI  |
| experiments and zero in production. I sell the governance frameworks  |
| and deployment playbooks that get AI from stuck to shipped.\"         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Supporting hooks:

-   **LinkedIn bio:** \"AI governance practitioner. I built the
    frameworks inside a real enterprise --- now I sell them so you don't
    have to build from scratch.\"

-   **Cold DM:** \"I noticed your company is hiring ML engineers but
    doesn't have an AI governance lead. That's usually the sign you're
    about to hit the scaling wall.\"

-   **Community:** \"I open-sourced my risk tiering logic. It
    auto-routes Low/Medium/High risk AI projects to the right authority.
    Here's the framework.\"

**1.3 The Origin Story**

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **The Story Arc**                                                     |
|                                                                       |
| THE PROBLEM I LIVED: \"I spent years watching AI initiatives die ---  |
| not because the technology failed, but because the organization       |
| wasn't ready.\"                                                       |
|                                                                       |
| THE THING I BUILT: \"So I built the system myself. Inside a real      |
| enterprise, with real stakeholders, real budgets, and real politics.  |
| A complete governance framework --- risk tiering, two-gate            |
| deployment, CoE charter, technical standards.\"                       |
|                                                                       |
| THE INSIGHT: \"95% of governance advice is either too academic to     |
| implement or too rigid to let teams ship. The breakthrough is the     |
| discipline of constraint --- governance that channels innovation      |
| instead of blocking it.\"                                             |
|                                                                       |
| THE OFFER: \"Now I've packaged everything into toolkits any AI leader |
| can deploy in weeks. You don't need to hire a \$300K governance lead  |
| or pay a Big 4 firm \$500K. You need the playbook from someone who    |
| already ran this play.\"                                              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

**Note:** *The "discipline of constraint" is the subtle Ving Tsun
thread. Philosophical enough to intrigue, practical enough to be
credible, and uniquely yours. Let engagement data guide how much to
amplify it.*

**Part II: The Product Suite**

The product architecture follows a tiered model designed to maximize
acquisition at the top and revenue per customer at the bottom. Every
tier delivers value AND qualifies the buyer for the next tier.

**2.1 The Funnel Architecture**

  ---------- --------------------- ---------------- ---------- --------------
  **Tier**   **Product**           **Price**        **Goal**   **Volume**

  **Tier 0** AI Governance         FREE (email      Lead       1,000+
             Readiness Checklist   gate)            capture    

  **Tier 1** AI Risk Tiering       \$47             First      60--80

  **Tier 2** AI                    \$197--\$297     Core       30--50
             Governance-in-a-Box                    revenue    

  **Tier 3** 1:1 Implementation    \$500--\$2,500   Upsell     5--10
             Call                                              
  ---------- --------------------- ---------------- ---------- --------------

**2.2 Product Details**

**Tier 0: AI Governance Readiness Checklist (FREE)**

A 2--3 page PDF scoring AI governance maturity across 5 dimensions:
Strategy Alignment, Risk Framework, Technical Standards, Organizational
Readiness, Deployment Infrastructure. Buyer fills it out, gets a score,
sees their gaps. Those gaps are exactly what Tiers 1 and 2 solve.

-   **Delivery:** Gated PDF via Carrd.co landing page + Mailchimp/Kit
    email capture.

-   **Build time:** 2--3 days.

**Tier 1: AI Risk Tiering Toolkit (\$47)**

Complete kit: Risk Assessment Questionnaire (adapted from your
framework), scoring logic, risk tier thresholds, decision tree for
routing projects, and quick-start implementation guide. An AI leader can
deploy this within a week.

-   **Deliverable:** Editable templates + Excel scoring sheet + 5-page
    implementation guide.

-   **Build time:** 5--7 days (adapting existing IP).

**Tier 2: AI Governance-in-a-Box (\$197--\$297)**

Everything in Tier 1 plus: CoE Charter template, Two-Gate Governance
System docs, Technical Standards for AI/ML Lifecycle, Model Card
template, AI Use Policy template, RACI matrix, 30-60-90 implementation
roadmap. This replaces \$50K--\$200K in consulting fees.

-   **Deliverable:** 10--15 editable templates + implementation guide +
    optional video walkthroughs.

-   **Build time:** 10--14 days for full suite.

**Tier 3: Implementation Call (\$500--\$2,500)**

60--90 minute 1:1 session customizing Governance-in-a-Box for the
buyer's specific org. Some calls naturally convert to ongoing advisory
at \$5K--15K. Zero build time --- you're selling expertise.

**2.3 Pricing Psychology**

\$47 is below the corporate card threshold --- impulse buy for someone
with budget authority. \$197--\$297 is the \"save 100+ hours\" sweet
spot. Always anchor against the alternative: \"This toolkit replaces
what a Big 4 firm charges \$150K to deliver.\"

**Part III: Channel Strategy --- Test & Double-Down**

With bootstrap budget and small LinkedIn, you cannot spread thin. Run 4
channel experiments in parallel during Month 1, measure at Week 3,
double down on top 2 performers for Months 2--3.

**3.1 The Four Channel Experiments**

  ----------------- ------------------- ---------------- ----------------- -------------
  **Channel**       **Tactic**          **Time/Week**    **Success         **Cost**

                    questions/day.                                         
                    Share free toolkit.                                    

  **Network**       Personal outreach   3--4 hrs         15+ responses, 3+ \$0
                    to 50 dormant       (front-loaded)   referrals         
                    contacts in first 2                                    
                    weeks. Reconnect +                                     
                    share.                                                 

  **Content/SEO**   2 long-form         4--5 hrs/week    500+              \$0
                    articles on                          views/article, 3+

                    per month.                                             
  ----------------- ------------------- ---------------- ----------------- -------------

**3.2 Target Communities**

-   **MLOps Community (Slack):** 15K+ members. ML engineer/leader
    focused. Your governance frameworks fill a gap here.

-   **Locally Optimistic (Slack):** Data leadership community. Directors
    and VPs. Perfect ICP overlap.

-   **r/MachineLearning & r/artificial:** Large but noisy. Best for
    long-form expertise posts. One viral post = 500+ leads.

-   **AI Leadership LinkedIn Groups:** Smaller but highly targeted
    decision-makers with budget.

-   **Austin AI Meetup (in-person):** Attend 1--2 as participant. Low
    effort, high trust-building. Test ROI before committing.

**3.3 Week 3 Channel Review**

At Week 3, run a ruthless analysis: Which channel drove the most email
signups? Which generated the most DM conversations with qualified
buyers? Which felt sustainable for 12 more weeks? Kill the bottom 2,
reallocate time to top 2. This is the strategy, not a failure.

**3.4 Network Reactivation Playbook**

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **The Reactivation Message**                                          |
|                                                                       |
| \"Hey \[Name\], it's been a while --- hope you're doing well. I've    |
| been building something new and wanted to share it with people whose  |
| opinion I trust.\"                                                    |
|                                                                       |
| \"I'm packaging the AI governance frameworks I built at Resultant     |
| into toolkits that AI leaders can deploy without hiring a Big 4 firm. |
| Risk tiering, CoE charters, deployment gates, technical standards --- |
| all ready to customize.\"                                             |
|                                                                       |
| \"Would love your honest take: does this sound valuable? And if you   |
| know anyone drowning in AI pilots with no governance, I'd appreciate  |
| an intro.\"                                                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

This works because it asks for feedback and referrals, not a purchase.
People help when you ask for advice.

**3.5 Backup Accelerators (Break Glass If Needed)**

If LinkedIn underperforms by Week 3, deploy these immediately:

1.  **Reddit long-form posts:** A 1,000-word genuinely helpful post on
    r/MachineLearning can generate 10,000+ views in 48 hours. Prepare
    2--3 as emergency assets.

2.  **Podcast guesting:** Your story is inherently interesting to AI
    podcast hosts. Send 10 pitches to mid-tier shows (1K--10K
    listeners). Even 2 appearances = 100--200 qualified leads.

3.  **Newsletter swaps:** Find 2--3 newsletter authors in adjacent
    spaces. Offer guest posts or swaps. Borrows existing trust at zero
    cost.

**Part IV: The 90-Day Execution Plan**

**Month 1: Build & Launch (Days 1--30)**

Pure execution. Build product, set up funnel, launch all 4 channels,
reactivate network. No revenue goal --- goal is infrastructure and first
leads.

**Week 1: Foundation (Days 1--7)**

1.  **Set up infrastructure:** Carrd.co (\$19/yr) + Mailchimp free
    tier + Gumroad (free, transaction fees only).

2.  **Build Tier 0 lead magnet:** AI Governance Readiness Checklist PDF.
    Priority #1.

3.  **Rewrite LinkedIn profile:** New headline, About section using hook
    from Part I. Pin announcement post.

4.  **Send first 20 reactivation messages:** Personal, not templated.

5.  **Join 2 online communities:** Introduce yourself. Answer questions.
    Do NOT pitch.

**Week 2: First Product (Days 8--14)**

1.  **Build Tier 1 (\$47):** Adapt Risk Assessment + tiering logic into
    buyer-ready toolkit.

2.  **Send remaining 30 reactivation messages.**

3.  **Publish first article:** \"Why 95% of AI Pilots Never Reach
    Production (And the Framework That Fixes It)\"

4.  **Begin LinkedIn posting rhythm:** 4 posts/week. Tactical tips +
    framework previews + pain-point content.

5.  **Daily community engagement:** 30 min/day answering questions.

**Weeks 3--4: Launch & Measure (Days 15--30)**

-   Launch Tier 1 product. Announce on LinkedIn, communities, email
    list.

-   Start building Tier 2 (10--14 day build).

-   Publish second article: \"How to Build an AI Center of Excellence in
    90 Days\"

-   Week 3 Channel Review: Analyze, kill bottom 2 channels, double down
    on top 2.

-   Collect first testimonials from early users.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

**Month 2: Scale What Works (Days 31--60)**

1.  **Launch Tier 2 (\$197--\$297):** Governance-in-a-Box. 3-email
    launch sequence to your list.

2.  **Build email nurture sequence:** 5 automated emails. Deliver
    checklist → war story → toolkit preview → testimonial → offer.

3.  **Double down on winning channel:** If LinkedIn works, go to 5--6
    posts/week. If communities work, become a regular.

4.  **Publish 2 more long-form articles.**

5.  **Explore 1 podcast appearance:** Pitch 5--10 AI podcasts. You don't
    need polish --- you need a good story.

6.  **Austin meetup test:** Attend 1--2 events. Bring cards with landing
    page URL. Goal: 5--10 connections each.

  ---------------------- ---------------- ---------------- -----------------

**Part VIII: Reflection & Stress-Test**

Three rounds of critical judgment applied to this plan, identifying
weaknesses and incorporating fixes.

**Reflection 1: Is 100 Customers Realistic?**

**Challenge:** 100 paid customers in 90 days with \<1K LinkedIn, \$500
budget, and no audience is in the top 5% of bootstrap outcomes.

**Assessment:** The math works IF the funnel performs at benchmarks. You
need \~5,000--8,000 impressions. At 2% free-to-paid conversion, 100
customers requires \~5,000 lead magnet downloads OR \~800 highly
targeted leads at 12% conversion.

**Strengthening:** Multiple acquisition channels hit the exposure
threshold. Honest range is 60--130 customers. Even at 60, you've proven
product-market fit and built a sustainable engine. 100 remains the North
Star.

**Reflection 2: Is the Product Differentiated Enough?**

**Challenge:** AI governance templates exist online. Why pay for yours?

**Assessment:** What exists is either academic NIST frameworks nobody
can implement, or vendor-locked compliance checklists. Nothing fills the
gap between theory and Monday-morning implementation. Your
practitioner-built, enterprise-tested toolkit is genuinely unique.

**Fix:** Every product page leads with "practitioner, not theorist." Add
3--4 redacted template screenshots as visual proof. Include a "Peek
Inside" section on landing page.

**Reflection 3: What If LinkedIn Doesn't Work?**

**Challenge:** \<1K connections means limited organic reach. Algorithm
favors large audiences.

**Assessment:** Biggest risk in the plan. Mitigated by the
test-and-double-down framework + backup accelerators (Reddit, podcasts,
newsletter swaps).

**Fix:** Prepare 2--3 Reddit posts and 5 podcast pitches by end of Week
2, deployable immediately if LinkedIn underperforms at Week 3 review.

**Reflection 4: Pricing Concerns**

**Challenge:** Too cheap to be taken seriously, or caught in
procurement?

**Assessment:** \$47--\$297 is deliberately under the corporate card
threshold. No procurement needed. Counter "too cheap" with aggressive
value anchoring.

**Fix:** Every product page: "Replaces what a Big 4 charges \$150K to
build." + "Saves 120+ hours." Raise prices in Month 3 based on demand.

**Reflection 5: Cold Network Risk**

**Challenge:** Dormant relationships have 10--20% response rate.

**Assessment:** 15% of 50 = 7--8 conversations. 30% referral rate = 2--3
warm intros. Low volume but high quality.

**Fix:** Message asks for advice/referrals, not sales (higher response
rate). Offer first 10 respondents free Tier 1 product for testimonials.
Early social proof \> early revenue.

**Part IX: Risk Register**

  ---------------- ---------------- --------------------- -----------------------
  **Risk**         **Likelihood**   **Impact**            **Mitigation**

                                                          clients.
  ---------------- ---------------- --------------------- -----------------------

**Part X: Post-Reflection --- Refined Strategic Priorities**

1.  **Lead with "practitioner, not theorist" everywhere.** This is your
    unfair advantage.

2.  **Prepare backup content by Week 2.** Reddit posts + podcast pitches
    ready to deploy if LinkedIn fails.

3.  **Add template previews to landing page.** Visual proof converts
    skeptics.

4.  **First 10 customers get free product for testimonials.** Trade
    \$470 for social proof worth \$10K+ in future sales.

5.  **Anchor every price against alternatives.** \"\$297 vs. \$150K from
    Big 4\" on every page.

6.  **Protect deep work blocks ruthlessly.** Content and product
    building in the morning. Always.

7.  **Plan B2B2B expansion for Month 3.** Sell to consultants who deploy
    across their client base.

**Final Word**

This plan is designed for one person with limited resources but deep
expertise and willingness to execute with discipline. The 90-day window
is tight but achievable because you're not building from theory ---
you're productizing experience you already have.

The single most important thing: ship imperfectly and iterate fast. Your
first landing page won't be perfect. Your first product will have gaps.
Your first posts will get 50 views. The compounding effect of daily,
consistent execution is what gets you to 100 customers. Not perfection
on day one.

*The discipline of constraint is not restriction --- it's precision.
Channel your energy through the narrowest possible path and strike
directly at the target.*
