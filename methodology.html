                <h2>Most governance wasn't designed for AI.</h2>

                <p>AI ships in weeks. Regulations shift quarterly. Agents are entering production. But most governance
                    still runs on annual reviews, manual checklists, and one-size-fits-all approvals. It was designed
                    for traditional software, not for systems that reason, adapt, and act. When governance can't keep
                    up, teams don't wait. They work around it.</p>

                <p class="closing">The question isn't whether you need governance. It's whether your governance was
                    designed for the AI you're actually deploying.</p>

                <h2>Governance designed for AI.</h2>

                <p>Governance shouldn't slow AI down. It should be the reason AI ships with confidence. That starts with
                    designing governance for how AI actually works, not retrofitting what was built for something else.
                </p>

                <p>Four principles define the approach:</p>
            </div>

            <div style="max-width:680px; margin:1.5rem auto 0;">
                <div class="principle">
                    <div class="principle-num">01</div>
                    <h3>Govern the portfolio, not just the model.</h3>
                    <p>The real governance challenge isn't any single algorithm. It's the system around it. Policy,
                        risk, lifecycle, vendors, costs, enablement, and compliance governed as one connected system
                        instead of scattered checklists owned by teams who never talk to each other.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="principle">
                    <div class="principle-num">02</div>
                    <h3>Match the governance to the risk.</h3>
                    <p>A low-risk automation and a high-stakes decision engine shouldn't go through the same process.
                        Precision Governance scales the rigor to the risk. Lightweight where it can be. Thorough where
                        it needs to be.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="principle">
                    <div class="principle-num">03</div>
                    <h3>Make governance operational, not theoretical.</h3>
                    <p>The biggest gap isn't the policy. It's the distance between the policy and Monday morning.
                        Ready-to-deploy documentation, frameworks, and decision tools that embed governance into how
                        work already happens.</p>

                    <p>Models are becoming agents. Regulations are shifting quarterly. Precision Governance is built
                        with regulatory alignment and a structure that extends into agentic AI as organizations move
                        from tools that respond to systems that act.</p>
