    <!-- HERO — Provocation -->
    <section class="hero">
        <div class="wrap">
            <p class="tag">The Perspective</p>
            <h1 class="h-xl">Three things I keep seeing<br>that nobody's <em>saying.</em></h1>
            <p class="body-text">After 14 years building AI systems inside enterprises, these are the patterns that keep
                showing up — in every industry, at every scale.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- OBSERVATION 1 — Recognition -->
    <section class="observation">
        <div class="wrap">
            <div class="obs-number">01</div>
            <h2 class="h-lg">The most expensive AI projects <em>aren't failing</em><br>because the models are wrong.
            </h2>
            <p class="body-text">They're failing because the organization around them wasn't designed for them. The
                approval workflows, the risk reviews, the compliance checks — all built for a world where humans made
                every decision. AI doesn't need that process. It needs a different one.</p>
            <p class="body-text" style="margin-top: 1rem;">The organizations pulling ahead didn't add AI to their
                existing operating model. They asked whether that model should still exist at all.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- OBSERVATION 2 — Recognition -->
    <section class="observation">
        <div class="wrap">
            <div class="obs-number">02</div>
            <h2 class="h-lg">Governance is the <em>accelerator,</em><br>not the brake.</h2>
            <p class="body-text">Deloitte surveyed 3,235 AI leaders. Their finding: organizations with mature governance
                frameworks scale AI faster and more profitably than those without. Governance doesn't slow things down —
                the absence of it does. Every stalled pilot, every compliance review that takes months, every legal hold
                on deployment — that's what happens without a system.</p>
            <p class="body-text" style="margin-top: 1rem;">The right framework turns governance from a bottleneck into
                the thing that gets AI into production.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- OBSERVATION 3 — Aspiration -->
    <section class="observation">
        <div class="wrap">
            <div class="obs-number">03</div>
            <h2 class="h-lg">The regulatory clock<br>is already <em>running.</em></h2>
            <p class="body-text">The EU AI Act is in force. NIST AI RMF is the U.S. standard. ISO 42001 is becoming the
                procurement baseline. Organizations that treat compliance as a future problem are going to discover it's
                a present one — with fines up to €35 million and market access at stake.</p>
            <p class="body-text" style="margin-top: 1rem;">The ones moving now aren't doing it out of fear. They're
                doing it because early alignment is a competitive advantage, not just a legal obligation.</p>
